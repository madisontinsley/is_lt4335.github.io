    My name is Madison Tinsley, I am a junior transfer majoring in Communication with a minor in Information Technology! I only recently discovered a passion for technology and code, which led me to begin a position at the Adaptive Computing Technology (ACT) Center at Mizzou. I work to ensure students and faculty with disabilities are able to use all websites and online resources. I have quite a bit of experience using HTML and CSS, it was the first “programming” language I learned, and I used it frequently in my Information Technology course last semester. My expectations for this course are to continue establishing a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, which I hope to use to create website designs that are easy and operable for those with disabilities. In my free time, I sing opera and classical music, as I was a music major for two years at Pepperdine University.
