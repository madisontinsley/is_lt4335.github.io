       <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>

       <p>This includes videos and pictures of my years as an opera
        singer, and the new journey I am embarking on with coding, as well as documentation
        from my everyday life.<p>

        <h3>It is my purpose that this website showcases all the things I am proud of so far, from
            music to painting to coding.</h3>

            <p>I often forget to be proud of what I have accomplished and
            where I have been. Since graduating high school, I have completely changed, much like
            everyone my age. I have moved across the country, lost and discovered passions, and
            started planning for the future in a whole new way. Suddenly, I found it hard to recognize
            myself from two years ago. It is now my goal to put it all in one place, the pictures, the
            videos, the art, and the people. This website is a window into my life, a celebration of
            who I am, a promise for a happy future for everyone and myself.            
            </p>

            <p>This website contains a page about me, a page about my experiences, a personal
                reflection page, and a contact page.</p>
