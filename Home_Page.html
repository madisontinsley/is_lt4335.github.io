<!---
    Use all HTML5 semantic elements (header, main, nav, footer) 
    (we will revisit this later to be more specific, this is simply to group your content for coding later!), for now, 
    you will have content inside the <header>, <main> and the <footer> elements and nothing inside the <nav> element.
Add the Content for your Home Page  
(see your Week 1 Project submission), plus any additional text needed
Double-check you have the proper page title and metadata in the <head> 
    - hint you should only have one metadata at this point!
Use <h1> and one other heading (choose from <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>) 
    - hint, H1 should be the only content that goes between the <header> semantic element!
Use <p> element - must be used for all text not included in another element. 
    - hint, this should go between the <main> semantic element tags!
Save AS your index.html file (If you have already created an index.html file replace it with this file.)

       <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>

       <p>This includes videos and pictures of my years as an opera
        singer, and the new journey I am embarking on with coding, as well as documentation
        from my everyday life.<p>

        <h3>It is my purpose that this website showcases all the things I am proud of so far, from
            music to painting to coding.</h3>

            <p>I often forget to be proud of what I have accomplished and
            where I have been. Since graduating high school, I have completely changed, much like
            everyone my age. I have moved across the country, lost and discovered passions, and
            started planning for the future in a whole new way. Suddenly, I found it hard to recognize
            myself from two years ago. It is now my goal to put it all in one place, the pictures, the
            videos, the art, and the people. This website is a window into my life, a celebration of
            who I am, a promise for a happy future for everyone and myself.            
            </p>

            <p>This website contains a page about me, a page about my experiences, a personal
                reflection page, and a contact page.</p>
