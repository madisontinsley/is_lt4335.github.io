        <p class = "box">My name is Madison Tinsley, and I am 21 years old. I grew up in Lee’s Summit,
            Missouri, about 15 minutes from Kansas City. I lived with my parents and our dog,
            Marley. Before I started high school, my older half-brother moved in with my parents and
            me. I joined theater and choir in high school, developing a passion for singing. I decided
            to pursue a music degree. I graduated from Lee’s Summit North High School in 2020. I
            went on to attend Pepperdine University in California to study Vocal Performance. I
            spent my first year online due to the pandemic until my sophomore year in 2021. After a
            difficult academic year at Pepperdine, I decided to quit music and transfer to the
            University of Missouri. I began my first semester in the fall of 2022 as a
            Communications major with an Information Technology (IT) minor, expected to graduate
            in December of 2024. I am working to complete certificates in IT, and I currently hold a
            student position in the Division of IT’s Adaptive Computing Technology center at
            Mizzou. I now plan to establish a career in technology after graduation.
